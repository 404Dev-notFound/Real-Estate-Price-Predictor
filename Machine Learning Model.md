## 🎯 What This Project Does

This project predicts housing prices based on various features like crime rate, average number of rooms, and more. It utilizes powerful machine learning algorithms to train on the **Boston Housing Dataset**, offering accurate price predictions with just a few inputs.

The project also compares the performance of different models: **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**, identifying the best one based on error metrics.

🧪 Model Performance Summary

Model                    Mean Error	         Std Deviation
🌲 Random Forest	       ✅ 3.33	               0.67                      
🌿 Decision Tree	          4.22	               0.81
📉 Linear Regression	      5.03	               1.06

✅ Random Forest performed the best with the lowest mean error and deviation.
